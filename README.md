OpenReact_Magento_Extension
===========================

This is a pre-release, UNSTABLE, beta version of a Magento plugin we are working on. Stay tuned for a complete and simple installable plugin

Installation instructions
=========================

1. Checkout the source/app directory into {MAGENTO_ROOT}/app
2. Flush caches in Magento admin (System / Cache Management / Flush Magento Cache)
3. Fix userroles. Go to System / Permissions / Users and System / Permission / Roles. Opening both pages should be enough for Magento to update permission rules.
